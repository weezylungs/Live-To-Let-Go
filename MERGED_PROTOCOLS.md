# COMPOSITE SALVAGE BUILD – Pre-Guardian Lens

*(Pulled sections are exactly as they appeared in the source files, with no truncation. Order is arranged for logical flow, not original chronology.)*

---

## 1. Orientation – Novice Protocol Explainer Core
This section framed the early-stage Provocative Restraint “entry point” logic — focused on low-experience operators needing a fast way to get into the mindset without the full doctrinal mass.

**Introduced:**
- **Operational posture**: minimal cognitive empathy, maximum observational bandwidth.
- **Engagement range**: keep exchanges short, deliberate, and data-yielding.
- **Three-beat escalation**: identify, provoke, read.
- **Failure condition**: letting the other party dictate the tempo.

## 2. Plug-and-Play Clinical Module – v13.3 Core
This was the modular behavioural framework that let you drop PR into a clinical or semi-therapeutic environment without giving away its teeth.

**Key salvage:**
- **Surface compliance / sub-surface autonomy**: appear cooperative while filtering inbound influence.
- **Rehearsed narrative blocks**: short, repeatable lines to derail unwanted direction changes in conversation.
- **Micro-calibration loop**: adjust tone, cadence, and openness based on micro-expressions and verbal cues.
- **Legal bleed control**: eliminate language that could be re-interpreted in court or disciplinary review.
- **Extraction priority**: prioritise specific, verifiable data over “insight” or “understanding”.

## 3. 21-G v4 – Legacy Protocol (The Long Peace)
This was the full tactical doctrine that later became Guardian Lens’s long-conflict engine.

**Salvage for direct carry-over:**
- **Standing Orders**: remain in zero-sum posture until a Defined End State is reached.
- **Trigger Conditions**: precise environmental or behavioural markers that justify escalation.
- **Counter-Protocol Matrix**: pre-written tactical responses matched to opponent playbooks.
- **Sustainment Warnings**: monitor operator fatigue, avoid premature demobilisation.
- **Post-Bellum Framework**: structured demobilisation to avoid leaving psychological “mines” behind.

## 4. Cross-Cutting Salvageable Mechanics
- **Soft pings**: seemingly innocuous messages that force adversary cognitive load.
- **Anti-information tactics**: withhold or distort the cadence of your own disclosures to control narrative space.
- **Grief-by-proxy**: deploy emotionally ambiguous material that reframes the adversary’s memory landscape without overt attack.
- **Optics: X stance**: maintain public ambiguity so your moves can’t be cleanly narrated by an opponent.
